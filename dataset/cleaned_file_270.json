Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins. Darwin Kastle is the designer of the popular Star Realms Deckbuilding Game, and with the digital release of Cthulhu Realms, he once again provides tons of playability for free, and a one-time upgrade to be able play with your friends and more on any device.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: \u25b6 Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). \u25b6 Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. \u25b6 Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. \u25b6 Play your game, with a character that you can control. \u25b6 Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: \u25b6 Black for stationary floors/ground; \u25b6 Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; \u25b6 Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; \u25b6 Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: \u25b6 \u201cCreate\u201d mode, to create your own worlds; \u25b6 \u201cPlay\u201d mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in \u201ccampaign\u201d mode (worlds selected by our team), or in \u201ccatalogue\u201d mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: \u25b6 \u201cEscape\u201d: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; \u25b6 \u201cDestruction\u201d: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: \u25b6 Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). \u25b6 Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. \u25b6 Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. \u25b6 Play your game, with a character that you can control. \u25b6 Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: \u25b6 Black for stationary floors/ground; \u25b6 Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; \u25b6 Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; \u25b6 Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: \u25b6 \u201cCreate\u201d mode, to create your own worlds; \u25b6 \u201cPlay\u201d mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in \u201ccampaign\u201d mode (worlds selected by our team), or in \u201ccatalogue\u201d mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: \u25b6 \u201cEscape\u201d: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; \u25b6 \u201cDestruction\u201d: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] \u25b6 Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. \u25b6 Choose vivid colors. \u25b6 Take pictures under good lighting.",

        "detailed_description": "'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: \u2018Unhappy Ever After\u2019 is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you\u2019ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, \u2018Unhappy Ever After\u2019 also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, \u2018Unhappy Ever After\u2019 is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",

        "detailed_description": "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala.

        "about_the_game": "Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed.

Just bring a friend or two along to keep the boss occupied while you stab him in the back. But make sure not to accidentally stab your friends while you're at it! Dying Death is not the end.

The Garonne Mercenary Corps, which once resisted the Orc's attack, appeared to be more lonely after the head of the team disappeared. The sudden mission of the Rose broke the daily routine of the mercenary group that survived the struggle. Is it a trap? Still an opportunity? What is hidden behind the royal mission? Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND \u5f02\u5e38 very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her. Linasha: The appearance is only 12 years old, but has a age of nearly 30 years old. Unlike the cute and well-behaved appearance, as the main magician of the Garon mercenary group Known as the 'flame elf', she not only has superb magical ability. And the love of mischief, so that the mercenary group of people have a headache. But at the same time, Lina Shah was slightly emotional, and even when she was a little bit of trouble, she even felt pitiful. No one knows what she experienced before coming to the Garon Mercenary No one has ever seen what she is behind that smiley face. Notes: All Charactors in this game are older than 18.",

As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles.

        "detailed_description": "Join our Discord Channel! About the Game -It\u2019s Your Responsibility to Change the World- Set on an Earth where mankind is being steadily annihilated by the alien invaders known as the BETA. Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that\u2019s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player\u2019s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they\u2019ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player\u2019s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factions\u2019 deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future we\u2019ll be adding: \u30fbMore TSFs to fight in. \u30fbVoice chat \u30fbBalance changes and roles to make team play more fun. ",

        "detailed_description": "Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system \u2014 your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms. ",

With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals.

Apart from your main weapon you also have access to hamster grenades and melee scratches! Use them wisely as they may be the difference between victory or defeat! Is your gun too weak? We got you! Pick up a new, stronger weapon from any of the weapon pickups around the map! Can you go on a rampage with your chosen cat? There are bonuses to your score when you achieve multiple kills! Build up that kill-streak as you get them all one by one! There are health and ammo pickups strewn about the map too, make sure to grab those and buff your way to the top of the scoreboard! Aligned Games\u00a9 was started by me, Johannes Christiaan Nienaber in 2013 as a video-game development studio. At that time I focused on the creation of smaller scale games, but have since moved into developing bigger and better games. I run the studio myself and as such all of its associated video-game are my sole creations. Please contact me through the Aligned Games website or Facebook page if you have any queries or questions.

Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them! ",

Slot Shots Pinball Collection Early Access features five tables, with one more table planned to release over the coming months for a total of at least six tables playable in this collection. Also included in the Early Access is a score attack mode- a one minute multiball thriller with increased mission and slot payouts (and each mode has its own separate online leaderboard system)! Super Vixel Land - A retro themed pixel/voxel super wide table that has missions on both the upper playfield and a lower playfield that has a revolving wheel! Slot Shots Casino - A fantasy themed casino playground that features a fully functional slot machine, which has a total of ten payouts based on your slot machine roll. This table also has a spinning lucky wheel in the back that grants various different awards based on where the ball drops down the wheel! Bass Hunter - A fishing themed table that also features its own custom slot machine. In Bass Hunter you will be completing fishing themed missions, such as catching the 'legendary' fish, while also collecting high scores from activating the slot machine that features different fish and tackle. Neon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. Outergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. PLEASE NOTE: This title is built on the Unity engine and there is a slight delay while playing if you use BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. The entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. Features full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. What do the Steam curators have to say about this title? Check it out!

        "detailed_description": "TowerClimb is a difficult and rewarding procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements. TowerClimb is set in a fantasy world where enormous and mysterious towers of ancient unknown origin stand above humanity, extending to the heavens. Humans are driven by curiosity to climb them, usually dying in the process. Struggle forward as a weak human, driven by an iron will to reach the top. The game borrows elements from the roguelike genre. A different adventure awaits each man; you will never play the same exact level twice. Run, Climb, Jump, Swim, and Fly your way up the tower's atmospheric and lethal worlds, using items and resources you find along your way. Quick thinking and strategy will keep you alive as you navigate the tower using unique platforming mechanics. TowerClimb is challenging, and rewards reflexes, skill, knowledge and problem solving ability. Quite often, The tower throws your character into dangerous situations which require you to think very carefully about your actions. A unique, randomly generated level system ensures players must always come up with interesting ways to complete a level. Hundreds of men will die before you posses enough skill and knowledge to conquer the tower. A screenshot of every man's death is saved, along with how he died, to track each and every attempt. TowerClimb at its core is an adventure platformer, with procedural levels and elements based on the rogue-like genre. It features local multiplayer support with an option for split-screen/single-screen. (a maximum of 25 simultaneous players is the limit. However, the game only supports 4 controllers (Xinput limitation). The remaining players must use the keyboard. A program like Xpadder can remap additional directinput controllers to keyboard keys) The game features a TON of content. The Tower is tall and daunting to conquer, with plenty of areas and secrets throughout the game. Getting/seeing everything will take players a long time. There's bonus modes to unlock and play on top of the main game as well. Each time you play the game, everything changes. The levels are different, random events can occur, rare items can be found, etc. The game will always keep you on your feet and give you refreshing challenges and experiences. The platforming mechanics in the game are set up to feel very tight and responsive in combination with the climbing mechanics. You always need to be on your feet and aware of your surroundings, while continually planning how to climb higher. As you progress higher, different worlds introduce new mechanics that mean your play style must evolve. 5 years in the making, by Davioware and Quazi, a team of two brothers who have been developing and playing games since childhood.",

Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each\u00a0containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a \u00a0thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards. Complete in-game quests that range from easy to hard and get awesome rewards! Open treasure chests and reap the rewards while you complete any level! Unlock custom hex piece\u00a0skins. Customize your board with that extra bling! Customize the game experience with 9 beautiful backgrounds! Cloud saving, achievements, stats, leaderboards, level editor, workshop and soon trading cards!

        "detailed_description": "Two Legends Reunite for the Ultimate Puzzle Match Japan\u2019s beloved puzzle game series Puyo Puyo and the world-renowned Tetris\u00ae game franchise have teamed up again to deliver even more Puyo-popping and Tetrimino-clearing fun! About the Game Two puzzle game juggernauts collide as Tetris\u00ae, one of the largest-selling and recognized brands in gaming history, and Puyo Puyo\u2122 from SEGA combine to create a fun-to-play, fast-paced, competitive party game like no other! There\u2019s a ton of different styles of gameplay \u2013 from the single-player Adventure and Challenge modes to the ferocious competition of the up-to-four-player Arcade modes. Unlock new characters and backgrounds in Adventure mode, or unlock new character voices, skins for Puyos and Tetriminos, backgrounds and more in the in-game Shop. You can even try your puzzle skills on a global scale by playing any of the multiplayer modes with up to four players online in Puzzle League or Free Play modes. FEATURES! Adventure Single-player mode offers ten unique acts, each with ten stages featuring different characters from the Puyo Puyo and Tetris universes. Each stage contains unique challenges players will need to overcome in order to win and move on! Multiplayer Arcade For up to four local players, Multiplayer Arcade offers a wealth of variety that will bring out players' competitive nature! Versus Players compete head-to-head in either Puyo Puyo or Tetris to fight in the puzzle battle of their lives. Swap Players' abilities are put to the ultimate test when they compete on both Puyo Puyo and Tetris boards, which switch back and forth at set intervals. Fusion A true hybrid game where players compete with Puyos and Tetriminos together on the same board, requiring deft, on-the-fly thinking to become victorious. Big Bang It's a race to the finish as players compete against each other to clear unique challenge boards as quickly as possible to win. Party Players compete on Puyo or Tetris boards, but the puzzles feature special items that when activated either help players or harm their opponents. Online Players can try their puzzle skills on a global scale by playing any of the multiplayer modes with up to four players online, in Puzzle League or Free Play modes. Puzzle League Increase player rating, earn ranks and aspire to new leagues in this mode for competitive enthusiasts. Free Play A more casual experience where records aren't kept and players can customize matches with unique settings, and invite their friends to play. Replays Players can save and upload any online matches to show off to their friends, or search other players' replays using the tag and filtering system to see how they tackle matches. Solo Arcade Play any of the Multiplayer Arcade modes against the CPU in Battle or Endurance matches, or try the single-player Challenges! Battle Substitute human players with 1-3 CPU opponents to fight against simultaneously. Endurance Go the distance in a one-on-one gauntlet of never-ending CPU opponents, racking up as many wins as possible. Challenge Forget about the opponents and put skills to the test with Sprint, Marathon and more, like the quirky Tiny Puyo, which shrinks down Puyos to fit even more on the board. Japanese VO For the first time in the West, players have the option to play with the original Japanese voiceovers with localized subtitles. ",

The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. \u30fbThe epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters.

        "detailed_description": "JOIN OUR DISCORD About the Game Are you ready to rock? Ragnarock is a solo/multiplayer VR rhythm game in which you play a viking captain competing in a ship race. With your two hammers, crush the incoming runes in sync with epic viking music. Keep hitting the runes perfectly to accumulate combo energy in your hammers, and you will be able to activate a speed boost! Viking music: The tracklist is curated with love and care. Unleash the drummer in you and play to the epic rock and metal tracks of Alestorm, Gloryhammer, Saltatio Mortis, Wind Rose and many more. All have a festive viking/celtic/pirate style, which will make you feel the viking power in you! Simple gameplay: Following the tradition of arcade games, Ragnarock is easy to play, hard to master. To move forward, only your sense of rhythm matters. However, to win the race, you will have to train and use your skills wisely. Multiple difficulty settings will help you improve over time. Only the most experienced players will be able to collect all the gold medals, beat the high scores and sign their name on the leaderboard! Cross-platform multiplayer mode: The multiplayer PvP mode brings real-time competition against your friends or other people. Start a public or private game (up to 6 players) and beat them all to finish in first place! In solo, you can also race against ghost ships (representing your best score or other players from the leaderboard) to add some competition. Mythological environments: Ragnarock transports you to the land of the vikings in stylized environments inspired by nordic mythology. Support for custom songs: Want to play a track from your personal music library? You can create a custom playable song from any song you own, and play it in solo mode.

To stop the evil, you\u2019ll need a focused team and perfect execution, with a single session lasting up to an hour. CAN YOU BANISH EVIL TOGETHER? Each themed DEVOUR map not only brings a terrifying new manifestation of the goat demon Azazel, but also completely new environments to explore, items to collect, fiends to overcome, and forbidden rituals to perform. Exorcise the demonically possessed Your goal is to break Azazel's hold on the cultists. On each map, work together in a race against time to find key ritual items \u2013 some of which might be alive and unwilling - to complete the banishment. Escalating difficulty Each possessed cultist\u2019s rage and speed increases as the game progresses, as does the number of fiends they spawn to stop you. Your only means of defence is your UV flashlight. Replayability Locked doors, ritual objects and item spawns are randomized, ensuring that no two games are the same. What's more, DEVOUR's unpredictable AI ups the game, making you second guess each and every move. Player progression Players earn experience with each playthrough, increasing their Cult Rank and earning Ritual Tokens. These are used to unlock valuable Perks, which can mean the difference between living to banish another demon or an agonizing death. Nightmare mode Beat the game without breaking a sweat? Try Nightmare mode for the ultimate challenge. Multiplayer features Make use of our in-game positional voice chat. Bring friends, or find other players using the server browser. Full VR support Ready to turn it up a notch? Play DEVOUR in VR without any additional purchase necessary. The Watchers DEVOUR is the prequel to the 2-player online co-op game The Watchers .

        "detailed_description": "Life In Yima is a pixel platform indie ARPG game made by a single lonely indie developer. This game is filled with rich main and side stories, several mini-games. It also features: - Dynamic day-night cycle, which takes an important place in the game mechanic. - Calendar system: the game records the story of Yima village between April and September. - Character development: Fighting monsters, Learning skills, Upgrading character levels and weapons, a simplified RPG experience. - NPC reputation: improving NPCs\u2019 reputations by giving gifts and spending time with them to unlock side stories. The production team led by the leader of the team \u2013 Baohua, comes to build a new village in the deep forest and accidentally find a lost person of unknown origin, the MC \u2013 Mayi. After deciding to take Mayi with the team, Mayi witnesses the process of the village from nothing to something as a helper. From the beginning to the end, the appearance of the village will be changed drastically! There is plenty of time for the game, and Mayi is also a favored one, and does not need to worry particularly about the difficulty of this game - even if she is inadvertently defeated in battle, it does not mean that the game has failed, and Mayi can even return to the game in a stronger form. (Even skipping time directly to the plot point is possible under certain situations!) Not only the main stories that must happen at a certain point in time, you can also unlock NPC\u2019s side stories by improving their reputations, along with nearly 30 CGs. Enjoy the leisure time with villagers~",

Whilst it would be advantageous to have played ' Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Regrets For The Future ', this episode can be enjoyed on its own. Not all characters are 18 or over. The Story Grendel Jinx : A lazy, megalomaniacal kleptomaniac Five years ago, she nearly suffered a fatal and self-inflicted accident during a school outing, saved only by the protagonist's fortuitous presence. After rescuing her, the protagonist is promptly coerced into signing a 'Friendship Agreement' form - a document designed to tie the protagonist to Grendel, both personally and financially, and then ultimately for the protagonist to join Grendel's organisation. With the arrival of the last day of term, Grendel needs to hand in her remaining homework or face the prospect of repeating a year. Drafting in the protagonist to solve her problem, Grendel is annoyed when her demands are swiftly rebuffed. Initiating a devious plan to ensure her education can progress without interruption, Grendel's actions soon attract her mother's attention, who has her own nefarious plans for the protagonist. Features By popular demand, CG graphics have now been introduced to enhance the gameplay. Funny and dramatic SHORT story. Gender selection, with gender-specific dialogue at various points in the game. Seven extra stories are available once the main story has been completed : ' Far Too Good For Us ' : Find out why the protagonist ended up in an upgraded broom cupboard (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Thine ' : A parcel arrives for the protagonist. Naturally, Grendel decides to open it (Part I) (accessed from the title screen).

Recently signed Grendel's ' Friendship Document ' (more out of pity than anything else). Doesn't realise what exactly that entails. Whenever Grendel gets behind on homework, she takes the easy way out : Force someone to write everything up. With the protagonist now Grendel's 'Best Friend', what better way of starting this friendship than forcing the protagonist to deal with sixteen different assignments ? Miss Potts is Grendels teacher. She dislikes violence. The protagonists current boss. Soon to be the protagonists' secretary and general dogsbody. Absolutely nothing can go wrong there. Wanting nothing more than their daughter to take over the world, the best way of achieving this is through relentless indoctrination and... ultra-violent anime programs. Cody and the protagonist dislike each other intensely. Chole is a hard-working Phoenix Custodian operative The protagonists' mother. Well-meaning but overbearing. She would like the protagonist to settle down and start a family and is more than willing to help find possible partners.

Whenever Grendel gets behind on homework, she takes the easy way out : Force someone to write everything up. With the protagonist now Grendel's 'Best Friend', what better way of starting this friendship than forcing the protagonist to deal with sixteen different assignments ? Miss Potts is Grendels teacher. She dislikes violence. The protagonists current boss. Soon to be the protagonists' secretary and general dogsbody. Absolutely nothing can go wrong there. Wanting nothing more than their daughter to take over the world, the best way of achieving this is through relentless indoctrination and... ultra-violent anime programs. Cody and the protagonist dislike each other intensely. Chole is a hard-working Phoenix Custodian operative The protagonists' mother. Well-meaning but overbearing. She would like the protagonist to settle down and start a family and is more than willing to help find possible partners. Believes the protagonist still works for a video game company but is ashamed to admit to it.",
        "short_description": "Grendel Jinx is in danger of having to repeat a school year. Refusing to allow this to happen, she enlists the services of the protagonist - her newly found 'Best Friend' - and is promptly rebuffed. Grendels drastic actions to fix her problem soon attracts the attention of her mother.",

His latest catch lies in his basement but she's not ready yet. Everything needs to be perfect for the ritual, when he'll show her 'True love'. The fan is a first person exploration game with a unique twist. Driven by a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, it will take you deep within the darkest places of Paris underground. Gameplay The Fan is entirely made with photos . It has a classic 'point and click' feel, using only left and right click but it's closer to the recent Telltale Game series than to traditional adventures games. There are no painful mini-games or artificially inserted sliding puzzles as it is more about discovery and choices. Find out more about the Killer and his victims as the story unfolds and you may be the one to ultimately decide their fate. WARNING : The game isn't rated yet but I wouldn't recommend if if you're under 16, due to the themes and some violent sequences. More About Me My name is Cyril and I'm a Frenchie indie game dev. The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough. So please, tell me what you think! Feel free to contact me directly if you have any question or comment, I'll be happy to answer! ",

Of course, it also has a high score challenge, which is very important in pinball! Each time you level up, the rate of increase in your score will increase.

Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay.

Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura\u2019s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you\u2019ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together. Deep beneath Antarctic ice, a Polish research team discovered an ancient temple that appeared to be a gateway to a fascinating new world.\u00a0 The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was a blessing for an overpopulated and devastated Earth. Project 'Gemini' was launched to colonize the new world. For 41 years, brave men and women traveled through the temple\u2019s singularity. But one day, for reasons unknown, contact with the other side was severed. To learn what had happened in the world beyond, a group of mercenaries was tasked with traveling through the unstable gateway. You are one of those mercenaries. Survive, and seek answers. ",

Choose from one of five unlockable characters, each with their own back stories, and reasons for being in the lair of Nexrolis. Each character offers a different style of gameplay. Play as the Pumpkin and absorb damage with the Thorn Shield, or choose the Skeleton Wizard and keep your distance while dealing damage from afar. Collect coins to spend in the shop, or kill Elites and collect rare items to assist you along the way. Battle through six increasingly difficult levels, and destroy Nexrolis to avenge the life that he took away from you. Floors of Discomfort combines the best of three different worlds to give one awesome experience. We have drawn from the roguelike idea of procedural generation and permadeath, making Floors of Discomfort feel different every time it is played. We have taken from platformers by adding simple platforming like gameplay, giving a different feel to what might be expected from a game like FoD. We have drawn from action games, making Floors of Discomfort a very fast paced, challenging, experience that will keep you on your toes the entire run. These three aspects come together to create a game that offers a unique experience that is both rewarding, and satisfying.",

Make sure to play this game in order to understand Heroes of Time 2 which is coming soon. This game takes place 1000 years after the events of Tales of \u00c1garis, in the year of 2130. Long forgotten are days of strife and conflict. Robots have been manufactured to assist with the police to keep the peace and security of the lands. Yet, not all is quite tranquil. A scientist, named, Aizack, uses his own robots to fuel a machine that he build to go back in time. To make the world one of his own design, he aims to steal a certain magical necklace that has lost it's potency in the modern age. However, 1000 years ago, it had the capability of summoning extremely powerful demons. The era that Aizack needs to visit coincides with the emergence of Gorgos, which was a dark moment in history. Henzo, Willie, and Lenna discover the scientist's plans and decide that he needs to be stopped. Both to preserve the present that they know, and to protect the future that they don't know. Would the three teens be able to nullify Aizack? Are you ready to travel in the time and save the future? And what if we take some selfies on this travel?

        "detailed_description": "THE GAME Damage is a violent but humorous 2D-adventure-shooter based on Amiga cult classic which was originally released in 1996. The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself. LEGACY About Amiga version (1993-1997) The enormous project of making an ideal game of our own started back in 1993. We soon became overly ambitious, and we had no idea of what it took to carry out our plans. But we couldn't give in, just took new challenges to make Damage the best it could be. In 1996 the game was ready and players loved it!",

Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'\u00e9cole de Paris, a star and an essential figure of Cubism. She became one of the most important characters of the 20th century avant-garde art. This virtual gallery is intended to pay tribute to the great artist on the 90th anniversary of her death in Paris, and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public. Her new languages and the most advanced techniques are shown in 65 works never seen before. This museum has several rooms marked by key dates in its history, accompanied by a virtual character who, from a few monitors, explains her biography in a playful and didactic way, corresponding to the works exhibited in each space.

What the game is about: Honey Rose: UFE tells the story of Red, a young university student with dreams of making it big at the masked fighting tournament . She looks up to Big Blue , the current champion, and aims to meet her idol in the ring ! However, she has a history of poor class attendance , and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. This year, she made a deal with her parents : she\u2019d either graduate, or they\u2019d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her one and only chance to make her dream come true! Thankfully, that\u2019s where you come in ! With your guidance, she needs to balance her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation. The game is a life-management simulation , presented as a visual novel , with beat'em-up elements . In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning! Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it! ",

Clazer uses technology, patented by LeadTech, that teaches you the proper way to lead a target so you can accurately hit it. Real physics are integrated that actually simulate the ballistics of various types of shot. Professional sport shooters have already provided enthusiastic feedback. Clazer is so accurate that it will improve your ability to shoot real targets using an actual shotgun. Have fun in three different environments : Skeet, Trap, and Five Stand. You have access to a practice mode that helps to better visualize missed shot trajectory. Competition modes for Skeet, Trap, and Five Stand integrate professional rules and guidelines. Compete on the global leaderboard or locally. A great party game! Clazer runs on Windows with support for the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Oculus Touch.",

As an added bonus, all of the extra cosmetic items and side quests are included in this remaster.

With the help of the Dragoneers, Sonia, princess of Astoria, pleads with Yuma to aid them in their fight to save their land from the Empire\u2019s dominion. Typically timid, will Yuma find the courage to realize the strength he has within him? ",

It is the Falkonir's sworn duty to watch over the lands to protect the kingdom from any encroaching armies or outbursts of wild magic and monsters. On a day like any ordinary, Aella begins training with her falcon, Horu, and her mentor. When suddenly the ground trembles and shakes, and a thunderous crack pierces through the air revealing that Mount Bohlgast has unleashed its stored nightmares. Wraiths begin to manifest and envelop everything in their surroundings. With Aella barely saved by Horu's newfound strength, it is up to the two of them to end whatever wild magic is plaguing their people.",

        "detailed_description": "Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation. The parameterization capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing or in 3D sketch module.

        "detailed_description": "Wishlist to stay updated! About the Game while True: learn() is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it\u2019s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it\u2019s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about \u2018wasting their time\u2019 (although we believe you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life! The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don\u2019t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press \u201cRelease\u201d button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you\u2019ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That\u2019s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it\u2019s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru\u2026 Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you\u2019ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it\u2019s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do. Now, you can become one of them (minus the money)! while True: learn() is the best game about being a data science specialist because no one else has been weird enough to make another one!",

Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul. ",

Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck! In this game you\u2019ll find: - good old platforms - lots of action and tactics - simple, exciting and original gameplay - 54 levels full of deadly traps - unique main character - 5 characters for walking through a game - perfect pixel art style.",

The original game was written in v\u00abk\u00e4n (Vexen) but I have used various translation scripts to translate the game into English. I've posted this on Steam so that people may enjoy a classical Vexen game which entertained many back in v\u00abkka firl\u00e4n I (Vexka Island 1).
